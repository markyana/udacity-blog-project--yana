            <p class="text text-stretch">I love when my perspective and opinions change. Apart from perhaps traveling, <b>books</b> are the best way that I have found to change the way I think.</p>

            <p class="text text-stretch">Here are <u>my favorite books that have completely changed my perspective and, therefore, my life</u>:</p>


            <section class="post-block">

                <div class="block-text">
                    <p class="text">I have read some other books by Tim Ferriss, but this one is by far the best one.</p>
                    <p class="text">In <em>The 4-Hour Workweek</em>, Tim teaches you to look at your job and work differently. He teaches you how not to waste your time on things that don’t matter and how to <b>focus on what truly makes you money and keeps you growing</b>.</p>
                    <p class="text">I guess <q>Work smart, not hard</q> is the best way to describe Tim’s methods. This book is a collection of great advice and resources that can turn anyone from a rat-race runner to a <b>freer, happier, and smarter individual</b>.</p>
                    <p class="text">If you want to know how to use your time right and how to make more money while working less, you need to read this gem.</p>

                <div class="block-title"><h2>2. <em>Principles</em> by Ray Dalio</h2></div>

                <div class="block-image"><img src="images/books-post-principles.jpg" alt="Principles by Ray Dalio book cover" class="image"></div>

                <div class="block-text">
                    <p class="text"><em>Principles</em> is an advice for those who want to learn from the mind of a person who dedicated his life looking for the <b>best methods to make decisions</b>. It is a brave book. It is a book for the brave. Many of these lessons require being open and real in order to be followed. This work teaches the reader how important honesty and loyalty are. It shows what integrity really means, how love should truly be expressed. It is <u>psychological, philosophical, and very motivational</u>.</p>
                    <p class="text">This book mainly taught me and will teach you how to be true to what you believe in and be strict with people around you. But it also teaches you to do it with creativity and integrity which makes everyone both respect you and be open with you.</p>
                    <p class="text">It is an amazing book for not just those who are trying to run a company but also those who are trying to run their lives.</p>

                <div class="block-title"><h2>3. <em>Anna Karenina</em> by Leo Tolstoy</h2></div>

                <div class="block-text">
                    <p class="text">This is by far my favorite book by Leo Tolstoy, although I haven’t yet read them all.</p>
                    <p class="text"><em>Anna Karenina</em> is a book filled with <u>juxtaposition</u> that teaches you not only how to make better decisions for yourself but also how to decipher the good and the bad in others.</p>
                    <p class="text">My favorite part of the book is that it includes <b>God</b> in its philosophy and shows how certain decisions can lead to a slippery slope if they are not stopped early enough.</p>
                    <p class="text">It is a very powerful book and, truly, I believe that everyone learns from it something that soother person wouldn’t. It is a very personal book filled with amazing, <u>deep characters</u> whom you connect with so well that you feel as if you’re living their lives.</p>

You might end up looking at things in your life in a much simpler manner that will alleviate the stress you might feel about small things.</p>
                    <p class="text">This book is truly great for dealing with things that you don’t have the strength to deal with at times. It gives you an alternative way of thinking that could help you breathe easier.</p>
