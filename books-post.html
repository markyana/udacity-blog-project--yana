                <div class="title"><h1>Books that will change your life</h1></div>
                <div class="author"><h2>by Yana Markova</h2></div>
                <div class="date">April 30th, 2021</div>
            </div>
            <div class="text text-stretch">I love when my perspective and opinions change. Apart from perhaps traveling, books are the best way that I have found to change the way I think.</div>
            <div class="text text-stretch">Here are my favorite books that have completely changed my perspective and, therefore, my life:</div>
            <div class="section">
                <div class="section-title"><h2>1. <em>The 4-Hour Workweek</em> by Tim Ferriss</h2></div>
                <div class="section-text">
                <p class="text">I have read some other books by Tim Ferriss, but this one is by far the best one.</p>
                <p class="text">In <em>The 4-Hour Workweek</em>, Tim teaches you to look at your job and work differently. He teaches you how not to waste your time on things that don’t matter and how to focus on what truly makes you money and keeps you growing.</p>
                <p class="text">I guess “Work smart, not hard” is the best way to describe Tim’s methods. This book is a collection of great advice and resources that can turn anyone from a rat-race runner to a freer, happier, and smarter individual.</p>
                <p class="text">If you want to know how to use your time right and how to make more money while working less, you need to read this gem.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="section">
                <div class="section-title"><h2>2. <em>Principles</em> by Ray Dalio</h2></div>
                <div class="section-image"><img src="images/books-post-principles.jpg" alt="Principles by Ray Dalio book cover" class="image"></div>
                <div class="section-text">
                    <p class="text"><em>Principles</em> is an advice for those who want to learn from the mind of a person who dedicated his life looking for the best methods to make decisions. It is a brave book. It is a book for the brave. Many of these lessons require being open and real in order to be followed. This work teaches the reader how important honesty and loyalty are. It shows what integrity really means, how love should truly be expressed. It is psychological, philosophical, and very motivational.</p>
                    <p class="text">This book mainly taught me and will teach you how to be true to what you believe in and be strict with people around you. But it also teaches you to do it with creativity and integrity which makes everyone both respect you and be open with you.</p>
                    <p class="text">It is an amazing book for not just those who are trying to run a company but also those who are trying to run their lives.</p>

            <div class="section">
                <div class="section-title"><h2>3. <em>Anna Karenina</em> by Leo Tolstoy</h2></div>
                <div class="section-text">
                    <p class="text">This is by far my favorite book by Leo Tolstoy, although I haven’t yet read them all.</p>
                    <p class="text"><em>Anna Karenina</em> is a book filled with juxtaposition that teaches you not only how to make better decisions for yourself but also how to decipher the good and the bad in others.</p>
                    <p class="text">My favorite part of the book is that it includes God in its philosophy and shows how certain decisions can lead to a slippery slope if they are not stopped early enough.</p>
                    <p class="text">It is a very powerful book and, truly, I believe that everyone learns from it something that soother person wouldn’t. It is a very personal book filled with amazing, deep characters whom you connect you so well that you believe that you’re living their lives.</p>

                <div class="section-title"><h2>4. <em>The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck</em> by Mark Manson</h2></div>
                <div class="section-image"><img src="images/books-post-subtle-art.jpg" alt="The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck by Mark Manson book cover" class="image"></div>
                <div class="section-text">
                    <p class="text">This is just a very fun book to read that will make you feel so much better about your life. It leaves you feeling strong and confident. You might end up looking at things in your life in a much simpler manner that will alleviate the stress you might feel about small things.</p>
                    <p class="text">This book is truly great for dealing with things that you don’t have the strength to deal with at times. It gives you an alternative way of thinking that could help you breathe easier.</p>
                    <p class="text">But, truly, it’s just so much fun to read.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="text text-stretch">Enjoy these wonderful reads! Remember that you always have the option to change how you think and getting stuck in the same thing for a long period off time ain’t pretty. Have fun!</div>
