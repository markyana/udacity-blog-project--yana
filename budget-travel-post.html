            <div class="text text-stretch">Want to travel but don’t have the money for it? We’ve all been there. Rest assured, traveling doesn’t have to get expensive if you do it right.</div>
            <div class="text text-stretch">Let’s take a look at a few ways how you could save!</div>
            <div class="section">
                <div class="section-title"><h2>1. Your stay</h2></div>
                <div class="section-text">
                <p class="text">Maybe you have some family members where you’re going? Or friends? Take advantage of this. Not only are you gonna be able to visit someone you haven’t seen in a while, but you would also be able to stay somewhere for very cheap or even free and have a personal guide who can tell you what to visit, when, and how.</p>
                <p class="text">Staying with people is actually cheaper even I you don’t know them. Take advantage of those who rent out a room in their home on places like AirBnb. They are probably used to getting travelers and will be able to lead you on local discovery as well. Just remember to be respectful. Although they aren’t you family or friends, they are still accepting you in their home. Follow their rules.</p>
                <p class="text">Many cities also have very cheap hostels. Although rooms might be shared with multiple people, it actually could be a great thing. You might meet a lot of very interesting people while you’re there.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="section">
                <div class="section-title"><h2>2. Your food</h2></div>
                <div class="section-image"><img src="images/budget-travel-post-food.jpg" alt="Street market on city streets" class="image"></div>
                <div class="section-text">
                    <p class="text">When you’re traveling on a budget, you probably understand that restaurants are out of your league. Take advantage of food markets where locals shop. You can ask your host where you might be able to find cheaper food.</p>
                    <p class="text">In many places street food is also very cheap. Just make sure to get street food in less tourist parts of the city if you’re looking for the cheapest types.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="section">
                <div class="section-title"><h2>3. Your transport</h2></div>
                <div class="section-text">
                    <p class="text">No, you won’t be able to rent a car. You will probably have to use public transport while you’re at your destination. Make sure that you know the prices. Sometimes it is cheaper to purchase a 10-day pass for the transport rather than pay for every ride if the option exists. Try asking people for rides when you can, and hitch-hiking can also work very well at times, but only if you’re careful, there are bad people everywhere.</p>
                    <p class="text">When it comes to getting to your destination, there are a few ways. To do it cheaper. If you have loyalty programs with airlines, take advantage o them. Make sure to travel on days that are cheaper, you can always check prices for different dates. Also, getting a round trip longer than at least 6-7 days will allow you to get cheaper prices immediately. Also, a great app/website for getting cheaper flights is Skiplagged. Although the trips and flights there might be not the most comfortable and take longer, they are going to be a lot cheaper than others.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="text text-stretch">These are the best ways to save money when traveling. If you’re careful and don’t get into the mindset of trying and buying everything you see, which can sometimes overcome a person in a new place, you will do just fine and might even be able to save money for more fun activities along the way.</div>
            <div class="text text-stretch">Enjoy your travels on a budget!</div>
