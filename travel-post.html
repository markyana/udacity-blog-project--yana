            <p class="text text-stretch">If you are someone who has never traveled outside your country, you might not understand the potential value that traveling brings. But reasons to get out of your comfort zone and explore the world are plenty.</p>

            <p class="text text-stretch">I try to travel as much as possible and have visited many countries over the past years. Traveling has given me a perspective like nothing ever could.</p>

            <p class="text text-stretch">Here are the main reasons you should consider saving the money and taking away the time for travel:</p>


            <section class="post-block">

                <div class="block-title"><h2>1. Meet new people</h2></div>

                <div class="block-text">
                    <p class="text">Traveling is a great way to meet people the likes of which you didn’t even know could exist. Opening your mind to a different way a person could act, dress, and speak is a great way to understand the diversity o cultures and people.</p>
                    <p class="text">Just knowing someone who is in a different part of the world can open doors to many opportunities you did not realize you could have before. Having such diverse connections can come in very handy.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="block-image">

                </div>

            </section>


            <section class="post-block">

                <div class="block-title"><h2>2. See new places</h2></div>

                <div class="block-image">

                    <figcaption>from Unsplash.com</figcaption>
                </div>

                <div class="block-text">
                    <p class="text">We get used to where we live. We almost start thinking that the entire world must have our same perspective. When seeing new places and new ways of life, we can realize that things that we worry about on a daily basis could be a ridiculous problem somewhere else.</p>
                    <p class="text">Seeing how other people live can make us realize that me might have been stuck and forgot that there are other things out there to think about, other issues, other ideas.</p>
                    <p class="text">Interestingly, the opposite is also true.</p>
                </div>

            </section>


            <section class="post-block">

                <div class="block-title"><h2>3. See your own life in a different way</h2></div>

                <div class="block-text">
                    <p class="text">When we travel and leave our lives behind, we can find ourselves discovering the ways in which we were wasting our time. Some people become clearly unimportant, some habits become obviously destructive, and many worries are realized as pointless.</p>
                    <p class="text">By leaving the place where you live, you can discover that you’re also leaving yourself in a way, It is almost like a restart button that allows you to find your focus and motivation once again, and allows you to easily drop what you should have dropped long ago.</p>
                    <p class="text">The important thing is to not forget about it when you come back home. Try to come back and not become the same person you were. Try to be stronger and better from your new experience.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="block-image">

                </div>

            </section>


            <p class="text text-stretch">These are the main reasons why I enjoy traveling so much and why I will never stop traveling. Traveling refreshes and motivates me. Every time that I travel I drop some things I do not need and I gain other things that I have been missing. And nothing can replace these experiences.</p>
