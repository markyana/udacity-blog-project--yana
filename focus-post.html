            <!--Blog content-->
            <p class="text text-stretch">Throughout many of my life’s endeavors I found it hard to stay focused on anything I was doing. I’m sure you have the same problem, so many of us do.</p>

            <p class="text text-stretch">We are living in a world full of distractions. We all know it, the social media, the music, Netflix, YouTube… There is no way to be bored. But boredom is what is often required in order to desire focus.</p>

            <p class="text text-stretch"><u>People living today can avoid boredom so easily that there is often no psychological reasoning in choosing something important over something that brings instant pleasure.</u> Of course, we later regret the amount of time we have wasted on pointless things. Can you imagine where you would be today if you never wasted a day in your life? Filling up your life with distractions is not how great things are achieved.</p>

            <p class="text text-stretch">Here are some of my favorite ways to stay focused when I just want to sit on my phone:</p>


            <section class="post-block">

                <div class="block-title"><h2>1. Motivate youself daily</h2></div>

                <div class="block-text">
                    <p class="text">Reminding yourself of the <b>‘Why’</b> is sometimes the best thing you can do to fill your focus. Why are you doing this? Who do you want to become? Where do you want to be? How do you want to live?</p>
                    <p class="text">If I ever go without reminding myself of my why, I quickly lose my focus and even the confidence in my ability to do something. This is why it is so important to remind yourself of why you're doing something.</p>
                    <p class="text">It can be done in many ways. Of course, you can follow accounts that motivate you on Instagram, but I wouldn’t advise that, because it might become an excuse or you to get distracted by your phone and those accounts might get lost in the great amounts of other content. The way you choose to remind yourself needs to be effective.</p>
                    <p class="text">Try to motivate yourself by finding <b>friends</b> and <b>mentors</b> who are at a point in their lives that you are trying to get to yourself. Try going to places that might bring you feelings of wanting to work harder. (I personally used to drive by very rich neighborhoods and imagine being able to live in places like that.)</p>
                </div>

            <section class="post-block">

                <div class="block-title"><h2>2. Make your work enjoyable</h2></div>

                <div class="block-image">
                    <img src="images/focus-post-enjoy-section.jpg" alt="Someone listening to music on headphones while working on laptop (from Unsplash.com)" class="image">
                    <figcaption>from Unsplash.com</figcaption>
                </div>

                <div class="block-text">
                    <p class="text">I like to keep chocolate or snacks near, and, before I was pregnant, I used to also sneak in cigarettes and beer while working on my computer. The only concern to have with this is to never overdo it. I allow myself a piece of chocolate or a cigarette after I do a certain amount of work that I feel satisfied with enough to <b>reward</b> myself. It is a subconscious thing, but sometimes it is exactly what allows me to stay working for hours, sometimes even for an entire day, without stopping.</p>
                    <p class="text">Also, <b>music</b> is a great way to keep work un. If you are able to listen to music while you’e working, I would highly advise you do so. Listen to what makes you feel good and excited. Avoid anything that might make you feel sad, I don’t think you want to be shedding tears while doing something important. That’s a great way to distract yourself from being focused.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="block-title"><h2>3. Split your work</h2></div>

                <div class="block-text">
                    <p class="text">At times the hardest part is to simply start the work, especially if you took a longer-than-usual break. This happens because your brain and body get used to the lack of work and focus. A great way to fix this is by splitting your work into periods of <u>pushes and rests</u>.</p>
                    <p class="text">I like to do 30 minutes. I work for 30 minutes and then do whatever I find fun for another 30 minutes (like Minecraft). Then I switch and keep going. This is a great way for me to get back into the groove.</p>
                    <p class="text">Surprisingly, it also allows me to be more creative. During my periods of rest, I often end up thinking about something that I should do different or I come to a new solution. Usually, when I return to my work, I am a lot more productive and work so much faster. That’s also a plus!</p>
