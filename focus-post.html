            <div class="text text-stretch">Throughout many of my life’s endeavors I found it hard to stay focused on anything I was doing. I’m sure you have the same problem, so many of us do.</div>
            <div class="text text-stretch">We are living in a world full of distractions. We all know it, the social media, the music, Netflix, YouTube… There is no way to be bored. But boredom is what is often required in order to desire focus.</div>
            <div class="text text-stretch">People living today can avoid boredom so easily that there is often no psychological reasoning in choosing something important over something that brings instant pleasure. Of course, we later regret the amount of time we have wasted on pointless things. Can you imagine where you would be today if you never wasted a day in your life? Filling up your life with distractions is not how great things are achieved.</div>
            <div class="text text-stretch">Here are some of my favorite ways to stay focused when I just want to sit on my phone:</div>
            <div class="text-section">
                <h2>1. Motivate youself daily</h2>
                <p class="text">Reminding yourself of the ‘Why’ is sometimes the best thing you can do to fill your focus. Why are you doing this? Who do you want to become? Where do you want to be? How do you want to live?</p>
                <p class="text">If I ever go without reminding myself, I quickly lose my focus and even the confidence in my ability to do something. This is why it is so important to remind yourself.</p>
                <p class="text">It can be done in many ways. Of course, you can follow accounts that motivate you on Instagram, but I wouldn’t advise that, because it might become an excuse or you to get distracted by your phone and those accounts might get lost in the great amounts of other content. The way you choose to remind yourself needs to be effective.</p>
                <p class="text">Try to motivate yourself by finding friends and mentors who are at a point in their lives that you are trying to get to yourself. Try going to places that might bring you feelings of wanting to work harder. (I personally used to drive by very rich neighborhoods and imagine being able to live in places like that.)</p>
