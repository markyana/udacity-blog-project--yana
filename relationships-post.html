            <p class="text text-stretch">I have had many trial and errors in my life when it comes to finding the right partner and so did most of the women in my family. It is hard choosing the right thing, especially when your desire to be with someone overwhelms the logical decision to wait.</p>

            <p class="text text-stretch">This will be my first point on the matter. <b>Learning to be by yourself is a decision only a strong person can make.</b> Being with someone just because this person is available and you don’t want to be alone is a horrible decision. More likely than not that person won’t be what you’re truly looking for.</p>

            <p class="text text-stretch">Making the decision to wait for someone who truly fits you is hard, because what if that person doesn’t exist? <u>But is it really so much better to live a difficult life with someone who doesn’t fit you than waiting for a while for someone who does?</u></p>

            <div class="image-stretch"><img src="images/relationships-post-couple-fight.jpg" alt="Couple holding hands and looking in different directions" class="image"></div>

            <p class="text text-stretch">Sometimes, in order to avoid the wait, people end up convincing themselves that their partner is much better than they truly are. Red flags suddenly become a momentary mistake that you can fix and fights could really be your fault as well, so you might be the one who needs to change. This is sad. Changing yourself is not what being with the right person ever entails. The right person will help you and motivate you to grow, not become a completely different person.</p>

            <p class="text text-stretch">When two people convince themselves that everything is okay when it is not, it becomes a codependency that is very difficult to break. Years could be lost to this ‘relationship’ until something radical happens, like cheating. More often this happens when one of the partners is a narcissist, or close to being one. It is a truly miserable existence that stumbles growth and achievement.</p>

            <div class="image-stretch"><img src="images/relationships-post-sad.jpg" alt="Sad girl sitting next to a phone" class="image"></div>

            <p class="text text-stretch">It is very hard for people to be by themselves, especially if they either never learned how to or their parents showed a bad example of doing so.</p>

            <p class="text text-stretch">Relationships need to lead to satisfaction, happiness, support, and peace. My friend once told me, <q>I don’t know what I would do without my husband. The support that he is in my life.. I don’t know how I could do what I do without him.</q> And that is the best explanation of a great relationship I can imagine.</p>

            <p class="text text-stretch">Keep waiting for the right person. God is keeping you single for a reason. Get ready for the person who is your perfect other half, and stop wasting your time on people who won’t help you grow but will only bring you down.</p>
